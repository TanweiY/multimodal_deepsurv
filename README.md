# multimodal_deepsurv
This study used Deepsurv to train a multimodal deep learning survival model based on clinical variables and epigenome-wide DNA methylation data. The clinical variables (age, sex, TNM stage) were first trained using Cox proportional hazard model, and then the prognostic index (PI_clinicial) was constructed for each patient. Next, the PI_clinicals was integrated into the loss function and training process of the Deepsurv model training the genomewide DNA methylation data. Finally, SHAP was used to explain the importance of the input CpG sites.
